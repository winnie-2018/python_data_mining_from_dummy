    "## 5.2.5 Logistic Regression Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression trees are comparable in function to classification trees. They may also be used for numeric estimation problems when the target variable is numeric or continuous: for example, predicting the price of a product based on several input variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The commonly used regression approach for classification problems is the Logistic Regression. Remember that the predictors or input variables may be categorical or numeric in either case. It is the target variable that determines the type of prediction required.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not examine the concept of Regression again in this course because students are expected to have learned Regression algorithms concepts in Statistics-related courses such as the Statistical Methods for Data Science course.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how we can use Python to build a classifier model using the Regression approach with the `LogisticRegression()` function, the following codes show the example of the implementation for the customer churn data set."
