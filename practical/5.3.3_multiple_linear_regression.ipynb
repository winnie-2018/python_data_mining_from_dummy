    "## 5.3.3 Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "Regressions are the most common method for numeric estimation problems when the target variable is numeric or continuous. In this section, we will implement Estimation to predict the estimate that a given customer will churn based on his/her demographic and transaction profiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of demonstrating the concept of Estimation modeling, and reusing the same churn dataset,  we need to transform the initially categorical target attribute type values ('yes' or 'no')  with numeric  values (1 or 0), though not entirely precise but somehow the 1 and 0 present a churn estimate value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python codes show the example implementation of the data modeling phase to solve the Estimation problem using a Linear Regression (i.e., `LinearRegression()` function) algorithm.  The comments embedded in the codes give explanations to guide the rationale of the programming logic. "
